# Weather Visualization

This project was a personal spike for learning d3 and making the graph responsive. The graph is responsive in the x-direction (width).

Working on adding a data cursor to the graph to be able to see a specific temperature and date.

* Added simple data point cursor similar to [this example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3902569).

Used [this article](http://animateddata.co.uk/articles/d3/responsive/) to get some responsive ideas.

You can view the graph at: https://robbiejaeger.github.io/sample-weather/
