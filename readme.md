# Weather Visualization

This project was a personal spike for learning d3 and making the graph responsive. The graph is responsive in the x-direction (width).

Working on adding a data cursor to the graph to be able to see a specific temperature and date.

Used [this article](http://animateddata.co.uk/articles/d3/responsive/) to get some responsive ideas.
